# quest-pp-calibration

This project focuses on the calibration of data from the permeation probes used in QUEST. It primarily includes the following:

- **Calculation of the pumping speed** of the permeation probe.
- **Conversion of QMS ion current** into permeation flux.
- **Calculation of the recombination coefficient ($k_u$)** on the metal membrane surface.

## Examples
The `example` folder contains the calibration results for the permeation flux, based on the PP8 measurement data from discharges **#34313–#34320** on **January 12, 2017**.
