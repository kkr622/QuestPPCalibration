# 01_extract_shot

## Overview

- **Extraction of Raw QMS Data:** Individual shot data is extracted from the raw QMS measurements, continuing until the start of the subsequent discharge.
- **Extended Time Window:** The time range has been extended beyond the data in `(Shot Number) PDP 8.txt` to properly observe the decay behavior after the discharge ends.
